In Java, the Closeable and AutoCloseable interfaces are used to manage resources that need to be explicitly closed after use, 
such as files, network sockets, or database connections. 
These interfaces provide a mechanism for releasing resources and avoiding memory leaks.
Both are typically used in conjunction with the try-with-resources statement, 
introduced in Java 7, to automatically close resources when they are no longer needed.

 1. Closeable` Interface:

The Closeable interface is part of the `java.io` package and is primarily used for I/O classes like `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Reader`, `Writer`, etc. It defines a single method:

java
public interface Closeable {
    void close() throws IOException;
}


 Key Points:
- Purpose: It's used to release I/O-related resources, such as files or streams.
- Throws: The `close()` method can throw an `IOException`, which indicates an I/O error occurred during the closing of the resource.
- Common Classes Implementing `Closeable`:
  - `FileInputStream`
  - `FileOutputStream`
  - `BufferedReader`
  - `BufferedWriter`
  - `Socket`

 Example with `Closeable`:

java
import java.io.*;

public class CloseableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


In this example, the `BufferedReader` automatically closes at the end of the try block, even if an exception occurs, because it implements `Closeable`.

 2. AutoCloseable` Interface:

The AutoCloseable interface is a more general form of `Closeable`. It was introduced in Java 7 and is part of the `java.lang` package. It also defines a single method:

java
public interface AutoCloseable {
    void close() throws Exception;
}


 Key Points:
- Purpose: It is designed for any resources that need to be closed, not just I/O resources.
- Throws: The `close()` method can throw a more generic `Exception`, unlike `Closeable`, which throws only `IOException`.
- Compatibility: All `Closeable` classes are also `AutoCloseable`, as `Closeable` extends `AutoCloseable`.
- Common Classes Implementing `AutoCloseable`:
  - JDBC connections (`Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`)
  - Any custom class that requires resource cleanup can implement `AutoCloseable`.

 Example with `AutoCloseable`:

java
class CustomResource implements AutoCloseable {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Using the resource...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Closing the resource...");
    }
}

public class AutoCloseableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (CustomResource resource = new CustomResource()) {
            resource.doSomething();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


In this case, the `CustomResource` class implements `AutoCloseable`, and its `close()` method will automatically be called at the end of the try block.

 3. Differences Between `Closeable` and `AutoCloseable`:

| Aspect                    | `Closeable`                              | `AutoCloseable`                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Package                    | `java.io`                                | `java.lang`                             |
| Introduced in              | Java 5                                   | Java 7                                  |
| Method Signature           | `void close() throws IOException`        | `void close() throws Exception`         |
| Exception Handling         | Can only throw `IOException`             | Can throw any `Exception`               |
| Usage                      | Designed for I/O resources               | Can be used for any resource management |
| Extends                    | Extends `AutoCloseable`                  | No parent interface                     |

 When to Use:
- Use `Closeable`: If you are working with I/O resources, such as streams or files.
- Use `AutoCloseable`: If you're handling non-I/O resources or need more generic exception handling in your custom classes.

 4. Try-with-Resources:

Both `Closeable` and `AutoCloseable` are typically used with try-with-resources to ensure that the `close()` method is automatically called at the end of the block, avoiding manual resource management.

java
try (ResourceType resource = new ResourceType()) {
    // Use the resource
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


The resource is closed automatically at the end of the block, ensuring proper cleanup and reducing the risk of resource leaks.

 Conclusion:

- Closeable is tailored to I/O operations.
- AutoCloseable is more general and can be used for any resources.
